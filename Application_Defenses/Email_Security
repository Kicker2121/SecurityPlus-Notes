Email Security
--------------------------------
THere are three main e-mail problems: viruses, spam, and phishing

Virus - Attach to files so e-mail file attachments are a very easy way to spread
   viruses. 

Spam - Unwanted and unsolicited email sent to many recipients.
   * Can contain malware as attachments.
   [-] Prevention on a Client System: 
      - Anti-Virus Software
      - Anti-Spam Software
      - Junk mail filtering
         * Setting up a whitelist and black lists.
         
Preventing Spam on an E-mail Server:
   * Install anti-virus and Install Server level anti-spam software
   * Server Level Anti-Spam Software:
      - Pre-defined levels of security, use white and black lists.

Closing Open SMTP Relays - designed into email servers, and allows them to
   forward email from one server to another. Open relays are most common
   method for attackers to send spam to emails and spoofed emails
   
Preventing Open Relays - Use strong athentication for your SMTP servers.
   * Disable anonymous relays.

Repudiation Attack (SPAM attack):
   Ex: Where someone accesses your e-mail server and send inflammatory e-mails
      to other people. They are spoofing the e-mails so it appears that they 
      come from you.

Using S/MIME to Secure E-mail - A protocol that allows users to send both 
   encrypted and digitally signed e-mail messages.

Using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to Secure E-mail - Uses asymmetric encryption 
   scheme for security. 
   * Is Peer-to-Peer System
   * There is no root CA or trusted CA hierarchy, must trust other users using
      the system. Uses something called a WEB OF TRUST to establish authenticiy
      in this decentralized system.
