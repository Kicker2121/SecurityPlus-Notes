Network Application Security
--------------------------------

Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Software - Network software uses connectivity between 
   participants in the network, and the cumulative bandwidth of the network
   participants in the network.
   * Uses a Mesh Network
   * Not a Hub-and-spoke network like a client server network.
   
Risk of Excessive Bandwidth Usage:
   * Efficiently distribute files
   * Risk: excessive bandwidth usage

Risk of Data Leakage:
   * Data leagage - data exchange is exchanged in clear text fashion by default. 
        Mitigation: establish configurable baselines that don't allow it.
