Password attack Facts
====================================

- Threat Agents
  * Methods to discover or crack passwords
  * Social Engineering
  * Brute-Force
  * Tools
    > SnadBoy's revelation: reveals a hidden password in clear text.
    > Keylogging: Captures a users screen and logging key strokes
    > Rainbow Table: Applies hashing algorithm to every word in a dictionary
       * results saved in a table or matrix
       * encrypted password is compared to the pre-computed hashed passwords in
         the matrix until a match is found.
       * This method applies the concept of time-memory trade off; that it can
         save an considerable amount of time, but expense memory.
       * rainbow tables or matrices: extremely large and expansive, consuming up
         to 30 GB of space.
  * Guessing
  * Hashed Passwords:
    > Sniffer captures authentication logon traffic and extracts the hashed 
      password from the network packets.
    > An account database file is accessed by an attacker who gained read access
    > An account database file is pulled from a backup

- Protection against password attacks
  * Strong Passwords
  * bw2Fs3d --> bob went 2 the 'capital' Florist shop 3 times daily.
  * Social engineering tactics
  * Protect access to the password file
  * Salt the hask to mitigate an entirely different hash value for the password.
  * Two-factor authentication implementation.
