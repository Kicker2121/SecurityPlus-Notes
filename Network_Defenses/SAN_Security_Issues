SAN Security Issues
------------------------------------------
"""""""NEEEEEDDDSS WOORRRRKK"""""""""""" on notes.


Storage Area Network
   * Multiple servers that all share a same shared storage area. Share a common
      storage device.

SAN Technologies - 
   1. Fibre Channel(FC) - Most expensive
   2. ISCSI 
   
Target and Initiators
   1. Target: SAN storage devices
   2. Initiators: Shared servers that connect to the shared storage device.
       - Connects to and communicates with the SAN target.

Implementing SAN Security Controls - 

Logical Unit Number (LUN) Masking - Implements security through obscurity.
   * SCSI, SCSI Protocol for communications between server and the shared hard
      disks. Server thinks its talking to a locally attached SCSI hard disk 
      drive. 
   * Effectively hide the HR volume from the SAN servers
   * Doesn't block access to the associated storage.
   
Fabric Zoning - Divides SAN fabric into seperate zones. Fabric that connects 
   everything together. 
   * Zoning: divide fabric into seperate zones.
   * Soft Zoning: SAN fabric is config that the server, the SAN host can only see
      the storage devices taht are associated with that zone.
   * Hard Zoning: SAN switch itself config to restrict communication between
      specific storage devices. Most secure.
   * Port Zoning: Define zones by the ports and the hosts connected to them.
   
Virtual SANs (VSANs) - Used to divide up a storage area network into multiple 
   logical SANs in much the same manner as you use VLANs on a standard ethernet
   network.

Device Connection Controls - Secures a SAN
   * Prevention: 
      - Port locking: bind a specific SAN ID number to a specific SAN switch.

SAN Encryption - Encrypt data that being transmitted between SAN servers and 
   SAN storage devices on a storage area network.
   * Fibre Channel - Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   * iSCSI - Ethernet LAN encryption protocol IPsec to encrpyt data being 
       transferred on the SAN fabric.
