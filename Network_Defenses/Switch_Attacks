Switch Attacks
-----------------------------
Switch - Looks at MAC addresses, not IP addresses
 * MAC Address: First 3 spots are the manufacture.


Mac Flooding - Flood switch with mac addresses, containing difference source
   MAC addresses. 
   * Turns switch into a hub
   
Arp Spoofing(ARP Poisoning) - Associate attackers MAC address with another 
   computers IP address. 
   * Default GATEWAY - Probably an upstream router
   * Sniffer / Man-in-the-Middle
   * A router in a switch network: sends data to specific computer
       Example: CABLETRO - Is a switch
   
Mac Spoofing - Changing the sources MAC address on a packet header. 
   * Used to bypass 802.1X port based security.
   Ex: Switch has four ports and swtch may be set up with 802.1X authentication
      port - based security. Switch says only certain mac address are allowed to
      connect into a port.

Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) - Used by cisco systems. 
   * Cisco protocol
   * Disadvantage of DTP - Allows rogue network devices to configure ports,
      that can change up configurations.
