Switch Loops Protection
--------------------------------------------

Switch Loops - Occur when two switches on your network are connected together with
   a cable in the wrong way and configured in this manner they end up sending 
   traffic back and forth to each other forever forming a loop.
   
Spanning Tree Protocol - Defined in the IEEE 802.1d specification.
   A link management protocol that provides two different things.
      1. Provides a path redundancy in case a swith goes down, but it also is
         able to block ports in order to prevent switching loops.
      * Important to Remember: 
         - Switched Ehternet Network
             Ex: Only 1 active path between two seperate hosts on same LAN 
                segement, due to having multiple active paths between two hosts
                on same LAN segment causes these loops in the network that cause
                traffic storms within the loop, duplicating messages, and they
                can grow in size.

How Spanning Tree Protocol Works
   1. Blocks switch loops wherein multiple switches are all connected together
      into a type of ring.
   2. 
   * Tree of switches
   * Allows Blocked Redundant Paths
   * Transparent
   * Root Switch: Root of the treee, center of spanning tree topology.

Port Types:
   * Root Ports: Configured to communicate directly back with the root switch.
   * Designated Ports: Do what switch ports do, forwarding frames.
   * Blocked Ports: form a loop, they provide redundancy.
   
Ports can exist in different states - Every switch using the Spanning Tree
   Protocol can exist in one of five different states.
   1. Blocking: Root switch knows active port & link to another network, blocks
   2. Listening: Connected and active, listening to any traffic near
   3. Learning: Port is active
   4. Forwarding: Recieves frames, decides on path, then transmits
   5. Disabled: Turns off

Sequence of States for Ports - Dont want a starting loop enabled so all ports will
   then progress from the blocking state to one of 2 different states. By doing
   this the spanning tree protocol forms this tree of switches.
   * Blocking State: Dont want a starting loop enabled
      - Listening State: Preparation to starting forward frames
         * Learning State: Listening and learning based on their mac addresses 
            - Forwarding State: Sends data and forwarding traffic along
      - Disabled State: Turn that link off to prevent switching loop.
