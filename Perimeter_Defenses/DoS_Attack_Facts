DoS Attack Facts
===================================

- DoS Attack
  * A single attacker directs an attack against a single target, sending packets
    directly to the target. 
  * DDOS attack: Multiple PC's attack a victim simultaneously. A series of 
    computers scan target computers to find weaknesses and then compromise the
    most vulnerable systems.
  * Steps for process:
     1. Attacker identifies one of the computers as the master(also known as
        zombie master or bot herder)
     2. Master uses zombies/bots (compromised machines to attack)
     3. Master directs the zombies to attack the same target
     4. Attacker is able to effectively hide his identity by being two hops away
        from the victim.
        
- DoS attack that use the ICMP protocol
  > Ping Flood
    - Attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo requests (ping) packets
      Steps:
        1. Attack succeeds only if attacker has more bandwidth than the victim.
        2. Attacker hopes that the victim wil respond with ICMP echo reply packets
  > Ping of Death
    - Also called a long ICMP attack
    - Uses the ping program to send oversized ICMP packets
      Steps:
        1. Attacker sends one very large ICMP packet (larger than 65,536 bytes)
           directly to the victim
        2. Size of packet causes the system to freeze, crash, or reboot.
  > Smurf
    - Attack is a form of DRDos that spoofs the source address in ICMP packets.
    - Requires attacker system, an amplification network, and a victim computer
      or network.
      Steps:
        1. Attacker sends ICMP packets to an amplification network or broadcast
           address. The packets spoof the source address to be of the target.
        2. Amplification network responds by sending packets to the target 
           (victim) site.
        3. Victim has thousands of replies to packets send by the attacker.
  
- Dos attack that use the TCP protocol
  > SYN Flood
    - Exploits the TCP three-way handshake
      Steps:
        1. Attacker floods a victim site with SYN packets
        2. Victim responds to each SYN packet with a SYN ACK packet
        3. Attacker does not respond with the last portion of the handshake
           an (ACK packet), leaving the vitim waiting for a response.
        4. Attacker continues to send the victim SYN frames with a spoofed address
        5. Victim continues to attempt sessions with the attacker, allocating
           resources to accommodate each of these inbout session requests.
    - Also known as a half-open scan attack
    
   > LAND
     - Attacker floods victims system with packets that have forged headers.
     
   > Christmas (Xmas) Tree
     - Also known as Christmas Tree Scan, Nastygram, Kamikaze, or lamp test segm
     - Uses IP packet with every option turned on for the protocol being used.
     - Christmas tree packets can be used to conduct reconnaissance by scanning
       for open ports, and also a DoS attack if sent in large numbers.
       
- DoS attack that use the UDP protocol
  > Fraggle
    - Sends a large amount of UDP packets directed to broadcast adresses aimed at
      port 7 (echo) and port 19 (chargen-character generation) with spoofed 
      source addresses.
    - Variation smurf attack, using UDP instead of ICMP 
  > Teardrop 
    - Attack manipulates the UDP fragment number and location.
      Steps:
        1. Fragmented UDP packets with overlapping offsets are sent
        2. Victim system rebuilds the packets, an invalid UDP packet is created
           causing the system to crash or reboot 
           
- Spamming
  * Is another form of DoS attack
  * Is sending unwanted e-mail messages
    Steps:
      1. Consumes bandwidth that is used by legitimate traffic
      2. Can fill a mailbox or hard disk and result in legitimate e-mail being 
         rejected
      3. Spam is often distributed by hujacking misconfigured SMTP servers.
      
    Countermeasures:
      1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)
      2. Srong anti-virus
      3. File and folder hashes
      4. reverse DNS lookup
      5. External firewalls
      6. Filters to block unwanted traffic
      7. System patches and updates
