IP Address Facts
================================

- Prefix
  * First 64 bits is known as the prefix
  * Parts of prefix are: ISP, Network, Subnet
  * Prefix length identifies number of bits in relebant portion of the prefix.
  * Indication: add a slash(/) following the length number. Full quartets with
       trailing 0's in the prefix address can be omitted
       ex: 2001:0DB8:4898:DAFC::/64
       
  * Prefix also identifies location of host: often refered to as global routing 
       prefix.
       
- Interface ID
  * Last 64 bits is the interface ID
  * Interface ID is not a host address
  * Interface ID's must be unique within a subnet, but the same if interface is on
       a different subnet. 
  * Ethernet Networks: interface id can be automatically derived from the MAC
       address. Using automatice host ID simplifies administration.
       
- IP address Classes
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 = Class ===== 1st Octet Decimal Range ==== 1st Octet High Order Bits ======
 * Class A -->      [1-126 *]                   0
 * Class B -->      [128-191]                  10
 * Class C -->      [192-223]                 110
 * Class D -->      [224-239]                1110


 - Class A: Network contains addresses for about 16 million network interfaces.

 - Class B: Network contains addresses for about 65,000 network interfaces.

 - Class C: its firts 3 bits set to 110
              * Supports 254 hosts on each of 2 million networks.

 - Class D: are 32-bit network addresses, all values within the range 
            224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 are used to uniquely identify multicast groups.
              * No Host addressses within the Class D Address space, since all the hosts
                within a group share the groups IP address for reciever purposes.
              * Supports: Reserved for multicast groups
