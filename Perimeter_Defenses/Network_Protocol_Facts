Network Protocol Facts
=================================

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  * Provides services that ensure accurate and timely deliver of network 
      communications between two hosts. 
  * TCP is an OSI layer 4 (Transport layer) protocol.
  * TCP is connection-oriented which means that it provides a guaranteed delivery
      of data between hosts through:
        > Sequencing of data packets
        > flow control
        > error checking
  * TCP Three-Way handshake is the process used to establish a TCP session. Also a 
    feature of TCP, providing service consisting of a serial two-way data stream on top 
    of the packet-oriented IP protocol.
  * 3-Step Process: requires both the client and server to exchange SYN and ACK  
    (acknowledgment) packets before actual data communication begins.
  * Steps of the process:
     #Example 1:
      1. A host sends a SYN packet to target host
      2. The target host responds to the original host with a SYN ACK packet
      3. The host responds to the target host with an ACK packet
     #Example 2:
      - Host A sends a TCP SYNchronize packets to Host B
      - Host B recieves A's SYN
      - Host B sends a SYNchronize-ACKnowledgment
      - Host A recieves B's SYN-ACK
      - Host A sends ACKnowledge
      - Host B recieves ACK
      - TCP socket connection is: ESTABLISHED  
 * What port does a packet play: -> port 5228

 * Note: FPT, Telnet, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, SSH, and any other protocol that rides over 
         TCP also has a 3-way handshake performed as connection is opened.
         TCP 'rides' on top of Internet Protocol(IP) in the protocol stack.

- User Diagram Protocol (UDP)
  * A host-to-host protocol like TCP; Universal Datagram Protocol
  * Is connectionless: that it does not include mechanisms for ensuring timely
      and accurate delivery, but uses a best effort delivery.
  * Has less overhead, but offers faster communications, but at an expense of
      possible errors and data loss

- Difference between TCP and UDP
  * TCP/IP has a three-way handshake there for connection oriented communication
  * UDP is more secure, fires and forget - most games work on this    

- Internet Protocol (IP)
  * Is an OSI layer 3 protocol that is connectionless and relies on upper layer
      delivery and connection orientation.
      
- Network Packet Exchange (IPX)[NPE]
  * An older protocol used with older Novell networks. 
  
- Network Basic Input / Output system (NetBIOS)
  * Used to describe the combination of two protocols.
      > NetBEUI
      > NetBIOS - non-routable protocol
      
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
  * Commonly used for troubleshooting and information gathering.
  * Works closely with IP in providing error and control information, and by 
      allowing hosts exchange packet status information which helps move packets
      through the internetwork.
  * Two utilities for common management
      > Ping 
          - an ICMP Echo request
          - used to determine whether devices are reachable and can communicate
            accross the network
      > Traceroute 
          - Determines how many routers (hops) are between the source and the 
            target
          - Determinies timeout requests values for each
            router
      
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  * Providing IP address-to-MAC address name address resolution.
  * A host that knows the IP address of a host can discover the corresponding
      MAC address.
      
- Domain Name System (DNS)
  * Distributed database that maps logical host names to IP addresses.
  * Steps for process:
     1. Host looks in its local cache to see if it recently resolved host name
     2. Information not in cache, checks the host file.
     3. If IP address not found, host contacts its preferred DNS server. If
        this DNS server cannot be found, it continues contacting additonal 
        DNS servers until one responds.
     4. Host sends name information to the DNS server.
     5. If names cannot be found in the zones, then it forwards the request
        to a root zone name server.
     6. 1st DNS server then request the info, from the top-level domain server,
     7. DNS server places the info in its cache and returns the IP address to the
        client host. Then places the info in its cache and uses the IP address to 
        contact the desired destination device.
        
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
  * Designed for managing complex networks.
  * Lets network hosts exchange configuration and status information.
      > Manager: Computer used to perform management tasks.
      > Agent: Software process that runs on managed network devices.
      > Management Information Base: Host configuration information.
      > Trap: Event configured on an agent.
  * SNMP version 2: added security features
      > Authentication for agents and managers.
      > Encryption of SNMP information
      > Message integrity to ensure that data is not altered in transit.
