*** 7 Layers of OSI Model ***

 7. Application: Integrates network functionality into host operating system and 
                 enables network services. Supports application and end-user processes, 
                 communication partners are identified, quality of service is 
                 identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any 
                 constraints on data syntax are identified. Provides application 
                 services for: file-transfers, email, network software, telnet, and 
                 FTP. 
        > Application Proxy Firewall
        > End User
 6. Presentation: Presents Data. Providing independence from differences in data 
                  representation (encryption) by translating from application to 
                  network format.
        > Restoration of data
 5. Session: Managing the sessions in which data is transferred. Establishes, manages 
             and terminates connections between applications.
        > SSL up to layer 7
 4. Transport: Providing transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, 
               and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control.
        > TCP or UDP
 3. Network: How data is routed across networks and on to the destination. Providing  
             switching and routing techniques, creating logical paths, known as virtual 
             circuitsm, for transmitting data from node to node. Routing and forwarding 
             are functions of this layer, as well as addressing, internetworking, error 
             handling, congestion control, and packet sequencing.
        > Logical Addressing (IP or IPx) - decided what addresses to be sent
        > ICMP, Routers
        > Internet Protocol (IP)
 2. Data Link: Defines rules and procedures for hosts as they access the physical 
                 layer. Data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. It furnishes 
                 transmission protocol knowledge and management and handles errors in 
                 the physical layer, flow control and frame synchronization.
        > MAC / Physical, NIC, Switches
 1. Physical: Sets standards for sending and recieving electrical signals between  
              devices. Conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio  
              signal through the network at the electrical and mechanical level.
        > Cables, Hubs, Switches
