Session Based Attack Facts
-----------------------------

Man-in-the-middle: 
 - Attacker inserts himself in the communication flow between the client and the server.
 - The client is fooled into authenticating to the attacker.

TCP/IP (session) hijacking:
 - Extension of a man-in-the-middle attack where there attacker steals an open and 
   active communication session from a legitimate user.
 - Attack takes over the session and cuts off the original source device.
 - State is manipulated so that the attacker is able to insert alternate packets into 
   the communication stream.
    * Countermeasures for hijacking:
        - IPSec or other encryption protocols
        - Certificate authentication
        - Mutual Authentication
        - Randomizing sequencing mechanisms
        - Packet time stamps & packet sequencing

Session Fixation
 - An Attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session; 
   Attack explores a limitation of web application manages the session ID.

HTTP (session) hijacking:
 - A real-time attack in which the attacker hijacks a users cookies and uses the
   cookies to take over the HTTP session.

Replay Attack:
 - Attacker uses a protocal analyzer or sniffer to capture authentication information 
   going from the client to the server.
 - Attacker uses this information to connect at a later time and pretend to be the  
   client.

Null Session:
 - Connection that is made using a blank username and password
    * Prevention:
        - Block ports 139 and 445 on network firewalls
