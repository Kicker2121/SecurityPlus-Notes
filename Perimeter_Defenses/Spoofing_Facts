Spoofing Facts
--------------------------

IP Spoofing:
 - Changes the IP address information within a packet
 - Used to: hide the origin of the attack by spoofing the source address
 - Amplify attack by sending a message to a broadcast address, and redirecting responses to a victim who is overwhelmed with responses.

MAC Spoofing:
 - An attacking device spoofs the MAC address of a valid host currently in the MAC 
   address table of the switch.
 - Switch then forwards frame destined for that valid host to the attacking device.
    * Used to bypass:
       - AP w/ MAC filtering on wireless network
       - Router access control list (ACLs)
       - 802.1x port-based security

Arp Spoofing
 - Uses spoofed ARP messages to associate a different MAC address with an IP address.
 - Can be used to perform a man-in-the-middle attack


** Countermeasures to prevent spoofing are:
    - Implement firewall and router filters to prevent spoofed packets from crossing into or out of a private secured network
    - Use certificates to prove identity, reverse DNS lookup to verify source email address.
    - encrypted communication protocols, such as IPSec.
