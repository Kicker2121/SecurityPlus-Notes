Wireless Attack Facts
--------------------------

Rogue Access Point:
 - Any unauthorized AP added to a network.
 - Can allow the unauthorized capture of credentials and other sensitive information as
   well as conduct phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks
    * Attacker with access to the wired network installs a wireless AP on a free port
         AP then provides a mehtod for remotely accessing the network
    * Attacker near a valid wireless AP installs an AP with the same or similiar (SSID)
         The AP is configured to prompt for credentials, allowing the attacker to steal
         those credentials.
    * Attacker configures a wireless AP in a public location and then monitors traffic
         of those who connect to the AP in order to capture sensitive information
    
    ** Mitigate and Protection:

    ** Put AP's in seperate virtual LANs
       Use site survey tools to identify hosts and APs
       Check connected MAC addresses
       Conduct an RF noise analysis to detect a malicious rogue AP

Wardriving:
 - Attacker scans an area looking for a available wireless networks.
 - Used with high-gain antenna or by driving around looking for unsecured wireless APs

Warchalking:
 - Draws symbols in public places to advertise existence and status of wireless networks

Packet Sniffing:
 - Eavesdropping, decoding of wireless transmissions

Initialization Vector (IV) Attack:
 - Is a seed value used in encryption.
 - Seed value and key are used in encryption algorithm to generate additional keys or 
     to encrypt data

Interference:
 - Signal that corrupts or destroys the wireless signal by APs and other wireless devices.

Near Field Communication (NFC):
 -
