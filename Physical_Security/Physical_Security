Physical Security
-----------------------------------

Prevention - Make a network a less tempting target to break into.

Detection - Determine when they broke in, what they saw, and when they did it.

Recovery - Breaches, Review your physical security policy to determine what 
   weaknesses allowed the attacker in. Fix any damaged that the breach caused. 

Defense in Depth: Layered approach to security.
   * Physical Barriers
   * Logical Barriers
   * Using both is a multi-barrier system
   
Perimeter Security - First physical barrier
   * Fence: VAN ECK
   * Guard: PHREAKING
   * Video Surveillance
   * Window Placement
   
Access Security - Second layer of defense
   > Attackers
   * Piggybacking: With consent
   * Tailgating: Without consent
   
   > Problem Points:
   1. Unmonitored Entry Points: No-one watching   
   2. Monitored Entry Points:   Someone watching
