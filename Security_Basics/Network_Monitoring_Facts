Network Monitoring Facts
================================

Logs - a record of events that have occurred on a system. Logging capabilities are
       built into operating systems, services, and applications. Log entries are
       generated in response to changes in configuration,system,state, or network
       conditions.
       
Load Tester - simulates a load on a server or service.
       Example: the load tester might simulate a large number of client
       connections to a website, simulate test file downloads for an FTP site,
       or simulate large volumes of email. Use a load tester to make sure a 
       system has sufficient capacity for expected loads. A load tester can
       even estimate failure points where the load is more than the system can
       handle.
       
Throughput Tester - measures the amount of data that can be transferred through
       a network or processed by a device (such as the amount of data that can
       be retrieved from a disk in a specific period of time). On a network,
       a throughput tester sends a specific amount of data through the network
       and measures the time it takes to transfer the data. This creates a 
       measurement of the actual bandwidth of the network. Use a throughput
       tester to validate bandwidth on your network and identify when the 
       bandwidth is significantly below what it should be. Also can help you
       identify when a network is slow but will not give you sufficient 
       information to identify why it is slow.
       
Packet Sniffer - Software that captures or records frames that are transmitted on 
       the network.
       > Uses:
          - Identify types of traffic on a network
          - Viewing of exchanging of packets between comm devices
          - Analyze packets sent to and from devices
          - View packet contents
          
Protocol Analyzer - special type of packet sniffer that captures transmitted 
       frames. Also a passive device in that it copies frames and allows you to
       view frame contents but does not allow you to modify and retransit frames.
       > Uses:
          - Check for specific protocols on the network - SMTP, POP3, DNS, ICMP
          - Identify frames that might cause errors
          - Examine the data contained within a packet
          - Troubleshoot comm. problems or investigate source of heavy network
            traffic
       Also shows the traffic that exists on the network and the source and 
       destination of that traffic.
